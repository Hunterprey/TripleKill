Generally, all materials mainly include three parts: “Promotion Video”, “Digital Application”, “Design Process Report”.
To be more specific:

In the “Design Process Report”, in the beginning, there are Research and Requirements. 

After that, there are our Design Process and List of tasks assignment. 
What is more, in order to fully show the prototype and the progress of our work, we also produce an Appendix at the end of the report, involving “Core concepts demonstrated about social and/or mobile aspects”, “Interface function dictionary”, “Users privacy guarantee”, “How to build the trust between the users(including students and business manager) and the APP”, “APP Promotion Strategy”, “User story”, ”Feedback from the testers”, ”How to connect two functions(Social&Food News) together”, ”The future of the APP” as well as “Questionnaire survey”.Actually, initially, we produced a Physical(Paper) Application and we take photos and the photos are also put into the Appendix.


Moreover, even though there is an Interface Function Dictionary in the report, in order to be more convenient for you to check the interfaces’ function, we construct a separated dictionary and it is placed in the outside.
